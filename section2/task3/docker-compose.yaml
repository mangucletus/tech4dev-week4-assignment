# The issues in the file include indentation errors and incorrect service declaration

# YAML is indentation-sensitive. The services key should have consistent indentation. 
# The flask-app and redis services must be aligned correctly under the services key.

# The flask-app service and redis service should be listed correctly under the services block

# In YAML, lists should use hyphens (-) instead of square brackets
# version: "2"
# service:
#     flask-app:
#        build: .
#        ports: ["5000:5000"] 
#     redis
#        image: redis:alpine
