# Issues in the Original YAML:
# Incorrect Label in the Pod Template:
#     In the template.metadata.labels section, the label key name is used instead of app. 
#     The selector.matchLabels refers to app: my-app, so the label in the pod template should match 
#     the selector key.

# The YAML indentation is inconsistent, which will cause parsing errors.

# corrected code is provided below: 

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: broken-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app  # Fixed label to match the selector
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
